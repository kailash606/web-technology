        <h1>DOTA 2(DEFENCE OF THE ANCIENT)</h1>

        <p>Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game by Valve. 
            The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a community-created 
            mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played 
            in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending 
            their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a 
            powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles
             of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to
              successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins 
              by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within 
              their base.</p>
